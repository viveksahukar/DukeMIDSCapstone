# DukeMIDSCapstone

This capstone project was done as part of Masters in Interdisciplinary Data Science program at Duke University from Aug 2019 to April 2020.

The python jupyter notebook is in the folder **vs_code_data**.
The data files cannot be released to the public since I worked under protected data agreement with Duke University and my Capstone partner, Conservation International.

### Abstract
Rainforest deforestation in Amazonia rainforest in Brazil is alarming and hence, the Brazilian government has implemented forest conservation programs such as Bolsa Verde. We evaluated the effectiveness of Bolsa Verde in Brazilian Amazonia rainforest in reducing forest cover loss in those areas which are also declared as Protected Areas. We used regression methods to determine the effect of various confounding factors on forest cover loss. We used matching techniques to balance the control and treatment groups in terms of values of the covariates. We found that Bolsa Verde is effective in reducing forest cover loss in certain areas only. We also concluded that covariates such as slope, elevation, distance to roads and cities are more helpful than air temperature and precipitation in studying the effects of Bolsa Verde.
